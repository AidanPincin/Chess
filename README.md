# Chess
I've finally done it!
I completly scrapped the first version I made and started from scratch because it was buggy and inefficient.
This new version Is way better with no bugs as far as I can tell and is only 400 Lines of code, way less than the orginal 1000.
The next step is to make the bot again and this time it shouldnt break the entire game(hopefully) and make some interactive changes while I'm at it.
Also I gotta add checkmate.
